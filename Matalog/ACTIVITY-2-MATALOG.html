		<p style="color:pink; font-size:20px;">IPHONE 15: THE OFFICIAL FEAUTURES</p>
		
			<ul>
				<p style=color:white;">The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus start at $799 and offer a good balance between functionality, longevity, and price, but if cost is the major factor for you.</p>
				<p style=color:white;">As with the iPhone 14 lineup last year, the iPhone 15 family includes a total of four models with two 6.1-inch iPhones and two 6.7-inch iPhones. The consumer lineup includes the standard 6.1-inch iPhone 15 and the 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Plus. The 6.1-inch iPhone 15 Pro and 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Pro Max represent the more expensive, higher-end models..</p>
				<p style=color:white;">The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus are each available in five color options: pink, yellow, green, blue, and black. Perhaps the most significant change for the lineup is a move from the Lightning port that has been present on every iPhone for over a decade to a USB-C port, although data transfers on these models remain at the same USB 2.0 speeds that were available with Lightning..</p>
				<p style=color:white;">The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus use the same A16 Bionic chip that debuted in the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max, using 20 percent less power and delivering improved performance and 50 percent more memory bandwidth compared to the A15 Bionic chip in the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus..</p>
				<p style=color:white;">Camera improvements include a new 48-megapixel Main camera with a quad-pixel sensor that defaults to capturing 24-megapixel photos. The updated Main camera also allows for a new 2x Telephoto option intelligently cropped from the full camera capture..</p>
				<p style=color:white;">Portraits no longer require switching Portrait mode, with the iPhone 15 automatically capturing depth information when a person, dog, or cat is detected in the frame. The new camera system also brings sharper detail, more vivid colors, and improved low-light performance to portraits, while Night mode sees similar improvements.."</p>
				<p style=color:white;">Battery life remains the same on the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus compared to their predecessors, with video playback for up 20 hours on the iPhone 15 and 26 hours on the iPhone 15 Plus. As with the last several generations, the iPhone 15 models support 5G connectivity (both sub-6GHz and mmWave in the United States), and they use a new Qualcomm X70 modem. In the United States, iPhone models again ship without a physical SIM card as carriers now use eSIM..</p>

		<p style="color:pink; font-size:20px;">IPHONE 15: DESIGN</p>
			<p style=color:white;">Available in 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch display sizes,2 iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max feature a strong and lightweight titanium design — a first for iPhone. This premium alloy — the same used in spacecraft — has one of the highest strength-to-weight ratios of any metal, making this Apple’s lightest Pro lineup ever. Both models feature a new refined brush texture, contoured edges, and the thinnest borders on iPhone. The Pro lineup is built to last, combining the strength of titanium with the toughest back glass in a smartphone and the industry-leading Ceramic Shield on the front. Using an industry-first thermo-mechanical process, the titanium bands encase a new substructure made from 100 percent recycled aluminum, bonding these two metals with incredible strength through solid-state diffusion. The aluminum frame helps with thermal dissipation and allows the back glass to be easily replaced. This new design highlights the Super Retina XDR display with Always-On and ProMotion technologies for an exceptional viewing experience.</p>

		<p style="color:pink; font-size:20px;">IPHONE 15: USB-CHARGING PORT</p>
			<p style=color:white;">You can charge your iPhone with a USB-C cable and power adapter compliant with the USB-C standard, including USB Power Delivery — such as the cable that comes with your iPhone. These cables and power adapters are widely available from Apple and other manufacturers. Connect the cable to the USB-C connector on your iPhone and to a compatible USB-C power adapter. Then plug the power adapter into a wall outlet.If you have a 20W USB-C power adapter or higher-wattage USB-C power adapter — like the one that came with your Mac laptop — you can use it with your iPhone for faster charging. You can also charge your iPhone by connecting it to the USB-C port on your computer.</p>

		<p style="color:pink; font-size:20px;">IPHONE 15: PERFORMANCE</p>
			<p style=color:white;">iPhone 15 models continue to deliver a high-quality, superfast 5G experience9 and improved audio quality on phone calls, including those made on FaceTime or third-party apps. Sound quality gets even better when users select Voice Isolation to come through loud and clear, even if they are somewhere noisy. iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus have eSIM, a more convenient and secure alternative to a physical SIM card, with support from more than 295 carriers. When traveling the world, users can stay connected through affordable international roaming plans from their existing carrier, or purchase prepaid eSIM plans in over 50 countries and regions, including Australia, Italy, Thailand, and more.</p>
	<hr>
		<p style="color:pink; font-size:20px;">IPHONE 15: SPECIAL FEATURES</p>
			<p style=color:white;">iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature iOS 17, making iPhone even more personal and intuitive with new capabilities: The Phone app gets major updates with Contact Posters, which allows users to customize how they appear to their contacts, and Live Voicemail, which leverages the power of A16 Bionic to see real-time on-device transcription as someone leaves a voicemail. Users can even pick up the call while the caller is leaving their message. Messages gets a new stickers experience, more powerful search, transcription of audio messages, and Check In, which allows users to automatically notify friends and family when they have made it to their destination safely. NameDrop gives users a new way to use AirDrop to more easily share contact information by simply bringing two iPhone devices together. The same gesture can be used to AirDrop content and more.StandBy gives users a customizable full-screen experience with glanceable information designed to be viewed from a distance when iPhone is on its side and charging. With support for Live Activities, Siri, incoming calls, and larger notifications, StandBy is perfect for a nightstand, kitchen counter, or desk.iOS 17 delivers many more updates, including Journal,11 a new app that helps iPhone users reflect and practice gratitude through journaling; improvements to autocorrect and Dictation; greater protection for Private Browsing in Safari; password and passkey sharing with iCloud Keychain; pet recognition in Photos; and much more.</p>
			
			<p style=color:white;">Emergency SOS via satellite can help you connect with emergency services under exceptional circumstances when no other means of reaching emergency services are available. If you call or text emergency services and can't connect because you're somewhere with no cellular and Wi-Fi coverage, your iPhone tries to connect you via satellite. To connect to a satellite, you need to be outside with a clear view of the sky and horizon. When you use a satellite connection, the experience is different than sending or receiving a message via cellular.</p>
